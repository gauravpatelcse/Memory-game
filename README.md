## Rule To Play:-
  * The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
  * The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
  * If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
  * If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
  * The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
  * Try to match all pairs in as minimum moves as possible.
